# Clone your fork of kodi's repo into the current directory in terminal
git clone git@github.com:gedisony/repo-scripts.git repo-scripts

# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd repo-scripts

# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins.git

#
git checkout jarvis


If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream
# Make sure you are on your 'master' branch
git checkout master
# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/master

'master' is only used as example here. Please replace it with the correct branch you want to submit your add-on towards.
*** i think you need to use 'origin/jarvis' instead of 'master'



#Create a new branch to contain your new add-on or subsequent update:
$ git checkout -b script.reddit.reader

#The branch name isn't really relevant however a good suggestion is to name it like the addon ID.


#Commit your changes in a single commit, or your pull request is unlikely to be merged into the main repository.
#Use git's interactive rebase feature to tidy up your commits before making them public. The commit for your add-on should have the following naming convention as the following example:
*** don't know what it means "single commit" (how to commit?)
*** go to repo-plugins and copy the entire folder plugin.video.reddit_viewer-master
*** remove the "-master"  --> plugin.video.reddit_viewer
***
*** this is what i did:
$ git commit -m "[script.reddit.reader] 0.7.1"

On branch add-on-branch-name
Untracked files:
        plugin.video.reddit_viewer/                <------ error message

nothing added to commit but untracked files present

edipc@DESKTOP-5C55U1P MINGW64 ~/kodi stuff/repo-plugins (add-on-branch-name)
$ git add .    <---- did this to fix the error.

$ git commit -m "[script.reddit.reader] 0.7.1"  <------- this will now work


#Push your topic branch up to your fork:

git push origin script.reddit.reader      <------- script.reddit.reader is the branch name you've made

#Open a pull request with a clear title and description.

*** on browser: click on pull request
upper left : base fork: xbmc/repo-plugins         base:    jarvis
upper right: head fork: gedisony/repo-plugins     compare: add-on-branch-name
(click on green button create pull request)

*** the clear title will be [script.reddit.reader] 0.7.1
*** (don't know what description) left it as blank

*** sent pull request on 6/27/2016






if need to change things...

git rebase --interactive HEAD~2
(bunch of vi stuff later...)
   *pick one  ("pick" the top of the list and "s" the bottom rest)
   *squash the rest...

(second vi stuff)
   use the "[script.reddit.reader] 0.7.1" comment and # the rest

(end bunch of vi stuff...)

** sometimes need to use "git rebase --abort" to start over

git push origin script.reddit.reader --force
